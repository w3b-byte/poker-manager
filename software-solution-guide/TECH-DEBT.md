# Technical Debt Documentation

This file documents any technical debt identified during the project, helping to prioritize future improvements.

## Identified Technical Debt

1. **Code Duplication**: Several functions across different modules have similar implementations. Refactoring is needed to create reusable components.
   
2. **Lack of Unit Tests**: Some critical components lack adequate unit tests, which may lead to undetected bugs in future iterations.

3. **Outdated Dependencies**: Some libraries and frameworks used in the project are outdated and need to be updated to their latest stable versions for better performance and security.

4. **Hardcoded Values**: There are instances of hardcoded values in the codebase that should be replaced with configuration variables to enhance flexibility.

5. **Documentation Gaps**: Some parts of the code lack sufficient documentation, making it difficult for new developers to understand the implementation.

## Recommendations

- Schedule a refactoring session to address code duplication.
- Prioritize writing unit tests for critical components.
- Plan an update for outdated dependencies in the next development cycle.
- Review the codebase for hardcoded values and replace them accordingly.
- Enhance documentation for complex modules and functions.
