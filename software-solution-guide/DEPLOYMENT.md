# Deployment Process

## CI/CD Setup
- Use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.
- Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file to define the deployment pipeline.

## Hosting Options
- Consider using Vercel or AWS for hosting the application.
- Ensure the hosting service supports automatic deployments from the main branch.

## Domain Management
- Register a domain through a provider like Namecheap or GoDaddy.
- Configure DNS settings to point to the hosting service.

## SSL Configuration
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates.
- Ensure HTTPS is enforced for all connections to the application.

## Monitoring Strategies
- Implement monitoring tools such as Google Analytics for user tracking.
- Use services like Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring.

## Deployment Steps
1. Push code changes to the main branch.
2. GitHub Actions will trigger the deployment workflow.
3. Monitor the deployment process through the CI/CD dashboard.
4. Verify the application is running correctly on the production environment.
