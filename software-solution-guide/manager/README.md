## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Build for production:**

   npm run build
   ```
4. **Preview production build:**
   ```bash

## Maintenance & Customization
- All data is stored locally (IndexedDB via Dexie.js)
- To add features, create new components/pages in `src/`
- For future cloud sync, add Firebase or similar as a new module
- See `copilot-instructions.md` for AI/human maintenance guidance

## Deployment
- Deploy static files (from `dist/`) to GitHub Pages or any static host
