# Key Decisions Made Throughout the Project

1. **Project Structure**: The project will follow a modular structure with clearly defined files for features, design, technical specifications, deployment, and documentation to ensure maintainability and clarity.

2. **Feature Prioritization**: The features will be prioritized using the MoSCoW method, categorizing them into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have for effective planning and resource allocation.

3. **Design Approach**: A responsive design will be adopted to ensure accessibility across various devices, with a focus on adhering to WCAG guidelines for inclusivity.

4. **Technical Stack**: The chosen tech stack will include JavaScript for the frontend and backend, utilizing frameworks that support rapid development and scalability.

5. **Testing Strategy**: A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, aiming for over 80% code coverage to ensure reliability and performance of the application.

6. **Deployment Strategy**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process, ensuring quick and reliable updates.

7. **Documentation Standards**: All documentation will be maintained in Markdown format for ease of readability and accessibility, ensuring that all team members can contribute and understand the project.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: A monitoring strategy will be established post-deployment to track application performance and user feedback, allowing for iterative improvements based on real-world usage.
